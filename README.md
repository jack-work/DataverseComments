## How to find App Id
Navigate to the following URL to view the details for the application in question.  You may need substitute the hostname with that which you normally use to access Power Apps.
https://make.powerapps.com/environments/{your_environment_id}/apps/{app_id}/details

## Known Limitations
- Due to system constraints, certain comment details (e.g. control names) cannot be shown. 
- By default, only the first 50 applications will be shown. This limit can be modified by editing the script directly to remove or adjust the result limit.

## üîß Troubleshooting
- **Trouble passing arguments?** Run `Get-Help .\Get-DataverseComments.ps1 -Full` for detailed parameter documentation.
- **Auth fails?** Run `Connect-AzAccount` again
- **Permission errors?** Verify Dataverse access rights
- **Module issues?** Run `Update-Module -Name Az`
- **Too many comments to read in terminal?** Follow the instructions to write to output file, and use a spreadsheet application to organize the data.
